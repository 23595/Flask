    Spanish is a global language, spoken by hundreds of millions of people. It is the official language in 20 countries, as well as Puerto Rico, spanning across Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The majority of Spanish-speaking countries are in Latin America, including Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina, which have the largest populations of native Spanish speakers. Spain is the birthplace of the language, but each country has developed its own unique dialect, pronunciation, and vocabulary. This linguistic diversity reflects the rich blend of cultures and histories in these nations. While Spanish is not an official language in the United States, it is widely spoken, with the U.S. having one of the largest Spanish-speaking populations in the world.

    <b>Costa Rica</b> is a Central American nation known globally for its commitment to environmental protection and biodiversity. Despite its small size, it houses nearly 5% of the world's plant and animal species, protected within an extensive system of national parks and reserves. This focus on ecotourism, coupled with its abolition of the military in 1948, has fostered a reputation for peace and political stability. Its culture, often summed up by the philosophy of "Pura Vida" (pure life), emphasizes a relaxed, optimistic, and happy way of living. Its varied geography offers travelers everything from lush tropical rainforests and active volcanoes to beautiful Pacific and Caribbean coastlines.

    <b>Guatemala</b>, located in Central America, is a country of vibrant indigenous culture and stunning natural landscapes. It is home to a majority of the Mayan population, and the legacy of this ancient civilization is evident in the numerous impressive Mayan ruins, particularly Tikal, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The country's landscape is dominated by highlands, volcanoes (some of which are active), and picturesque lakes like Lake Atitlán, surrounded by volcanoes and traditional Mayan villages. While it has faced political and economic challenges, Guatemala's culture is rich with traditional textiles, colorful markets, and deep-rooted customs, offering a fascinating blend of ancient history and modern life.

    <b>Peru</b> is a country in western South America famous for being the heart of the ancient Inca Empire. Its most iconic landmark is Machu Picchu, the spectacular 15th-century Inca citadel nestled high in the Andes mountains. Peru boasts extraordinary geographical diversity, encompassing the arid Pacific coast, the towering Andean highlands, and the dense Amazon rainforest, which covers over half the country. The nation's culture is a vibrant blend of indigenous Andean traditions—including the use of Quechua and Aymara languages—and Spanish colonial influences. In recent years, Peru has also gained international acclaim for its sophisticated gastronomy, with its capital, Lima, often cited as a culinary capital of South America, known for dishes like ceviche.
